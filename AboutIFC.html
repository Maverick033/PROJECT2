  <h1 ><strong>The Pillars</strong></h1>
</div>
<div class="container borders">
  <h3 class="TopBorders"><strong>Scholarship &amp; Learning</strong></h3>
  <p class="text-justify">Helping members achieve scholastic excellence is one of the primary goals of the Greek Community. Each chapter maintains a unique scholarship program designed to challenge its members into higher standards and recognize outstanding academic achievement. Fraternity men and the Greek Community as a whole consistently produce a higher GPA average than that of non-affiliated Miami students.</p>
  <h3><strong>Service &amp; Philanthropy</strong></h3>
  <p>The Miami University Greek Community values service to the campus and greater Oxford community, which is reflected upon each individual chapter in their active involvement in many philanthropic activities. Both chapters and the Interfraternity Council sponsor and hold events throughout the academic year.</p>
  <h3><strong>Leadership</strong></h3>
  <p>Fraternal organizations provide individuals with many leadership opportunities. Chapter members have the chance to participate in leadership training, education, and development with their respective chapters and governing councils, as well as hold elected positions in their individualchapters and the Interfraternity Council. These opportunities provide excellent experience that can be carried on to other aspects of life, namely in future careers.</p>
  <h3><strong>Community</strong></h3>
  <p>Fraternities offer a social outlet to members in a variety of ways. Each organization sponsors events such as Homecoming, Parent's Weekends, and socials with other chapters. Fraternities also participate in year-round intramural leagues as well as Greek Week every fall semester. These programs provide members with diverse opportunities to interact and develop strong friendships throughout the community.</p>
  <h3><strong>Brotherhood</strong></h3>
  <p>Brotherhood is the bond of unity and friendship that lasts a lifetime. These bonds are not only among members of each individual chapter, but also amongst chapters in the Greek Community here at Miami and around the nation. Greek Life provides the opportunity to meet other students with diverse backgrounds, similar interests, and new perspectives. The members of our Greek Community support each other through the day-to-day challenges of college and create memories that will last a lifetime.</p>

    <h1><strong> History </strong></h1>
    <p class="text-justify center-block col-lg-12 styleguide TopBorders BottomBorders">Who are we? We are the next generation of achievers, believers, dreamers and go-getters. We are not just the leaders of tomorrow; we are the leaders of today. A community of tradition, passion and brotherhood. Joining a fraternity is like finding a home, a place filled with people who share similar values, interests and beliefs. The Miami Triad: Beta Theta Pi (1839), Phi Delta Theta (1848), and Sigma Chi (1855), were founded as a result of gentlemen not finding their home, but building it. With the founding of Delta Zeta (1902) and Phi Kappa Tau (1906), Miami University spurred the formation of five Greek-Letter organizations. These chapters did not flourish until fellow Miamians joined them, building them into what they are today.
    	  
    	  Some of these organizations have roots so deeply ingrained that their history is intertwined with that of Miami. Richard Farmer, a brother of Delta Tau Delta at Miami, help found the Farmer School of Business, Richard Graeter, a brother of Lambda Chi Alpha at Miami, is now the current owner of Graeter’s, the Cincinnati based ice cream company that now has a shop uptown. Delta Upsilon, whose puddle pull philanthropy event has been in place for over six decades, is a staple of Greek life forever imprinted in the seal of Miami University.      
    	  
    	  Other fraternities have roots so deep that they not only define Miami, but the current America that we live in. Paul Ryan, former Vice Presidential candidate and a brother of Delta Tau Delta at Miami University, is the current Speaker of the House. Greek life is not just a club, it’s a commitment to something greater than oneself, extending back generations. We are just the most recent links in a chain that extends back over a hundred years before we were born and will continue to grow long after we have moved on from Miami. </p>
